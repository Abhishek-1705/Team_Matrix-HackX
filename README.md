# Team_Matrix
 During pandemic, we all have faced various issue while taking the online classes whether it was about the classes or 
about clearing our dobuts,So me and my team came up with this idea of How a users can easily able connect or to
interact with the mentors and hence we end up making our project "MATRIX ". This project mainly focus on the user 
friendly interaction, it includes the two types of chatbox public and private.Public chatbox are for all the users that enters 
our program and private chatbox is for the users that takes up our plans
the O2O i.e. one to one interaction which means that in class of only 5 person a users can able connect and clears his/her doubts
clearly.This feature of our program will also be benefical for the mentors,they can able to check the progress of the students.
